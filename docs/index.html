        A project created by Franz-Aurel Huber and Marcus Fichtinger 
        during the creative codelabs at the UAS St. Pölten.
      </p>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p class="text-center">
        We have chosen use case C and decided to develop our own idea.
        The app is supposed to be a habit tracker. It should help users of any age keep track of a habit and keep those habits or maybe break bad habits in the long term. <br>
        Users can add habits they want to get accustomed to into their daily life. They then can tick a habit they have done for that day as finished. Users can get reminded by the app, 
        that they should check on their habits and also get motivated through them. <br>
        <h4>Example use cases:</h4>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Drinking more water</li>
          <li>Getting more active</li>
          <li>Read x amount of pages of a book</li>
          <li>Meditate</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Some example apps:</h4>

      <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
      <p>For the heuristic evaluation, Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics were used.</p>
    
      <h4>Visibility of system status:</h4>
      <p><strong>Positive:</strong> The app provides feedback through UI elements like toasts and text updates.</p>
    
      <h4>Match between system and the real world:</h4>
      <p><strong>Positive:</strong> The use of icons for "Add", "Edit", and "Stats" is in line with other apps, well-known and consistent.</p>
      <p><strong>Negative:</strong> Some technical terms or icons, such as the circle when it is not checked, might not be intuitive for all users.</p>
    
      <h4>User control and freedom:</h4>
      <p><strong>Positive:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Users can navigate back using the "Back" button or the system-wide gesture.</li>
        <li>Users can undo a checkmark by using the same swipe gesture or by tapping the same button again.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Negative:</strong> The delete button might be frustrating because of accidental deletion, because there is no confirmation dialog, for example. (Changes will be made accordingly)</p>
    
      <h4>Consistency and standards:</h4>
      <p><strong>Positive:</strong> The app uses consistent design patterns and color schemes.</p>
      <p><strong>Negative:</strong> A swiping gesture might not be the most known standard (intuitive) for ticking off a checkmark, therefore a tap to check should also be implemented. (Changes will be made accordingly)</p>
    
      <h4>Error prevention:</h4>
      <p><strong>Positive:</strong> The app minimizes errors by providing clear options and feedback, such as when trying to check a habit on a day other than the set repeating day.</p>
      <p><strong>Negative:</strong> Some error prevention mechanisms might be too restrictive, limiting user flexibility. (Delete confirmation might slow down a user)</p>
    
      <h4>Recognition rather than recall:</h4>
      <p><strong>Positive:</strong> The app displays options and information directly, reducing the need for memory.</p>
      <p><strong>Negative:</strong> Users need to remember which day they set to repeat on the main screen, because it only tells the user how many days in the month this day exists. A user also needs to remember the swipe gestures (Changes for redundancy will be implemented - Expert Users)</p>
    
      <h4>Flexibility and efficiency of use:</h4>
      <p><strong>Positive:</strong> The app supports efficient navigation with buttons, gestures and transitions.</p>
      <p><strong>Negative:</strong> Advanced users might find the app lacking in terms of customization options.</p>
    
      <h4>Aesthetic and minimalist design:</h4>
      <p><strong>Positive:</strong> The design is clean and focused, with minimal clutter.</p>
      <p><strong>Negative:</strong> Minimalist design might lead to oversimplification, hiding important features or information behind icons etc.</p>
    
      <h4>Recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:</h4>
      <p><strong>Positive:</strong> The app provides clear feedback for actions, helping users understand the system state.</p>
      <p><strong>Negative:</strong> Error messages might not be detailed enough to help users diagnose and recover from issues.</p>
    
      <h4>Help and documentation:</h4>
      <p><strong>Positive:</strong> The app's design is intuitive, reducing the need for any documentation.</p>
      <p><strong>Negative:</strong> Lack of any tutorials or documentation might leave users confused and frustrated. (Changes have been made - Onboarding added for first-time users)</p>

    <h3>Test Protocol</h3>
    <p class="text-center">
      The main focus of our user test is to find out any problems or unintuitive elements of the app. By testing the ease of use of many functionalities of the app, we want to determine if there are confusing or unintuitive parts that need reiterating. Besides the methods mentioned below, observations also play a part in determining where a user might be struggling.
      Information about the user test was given to the participants at the beginning of the form.
    </p>
    <h4>Hypothesis</h4>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>It is intuitive to create a repeating habit. → Ease of use of adding a new habit</li>
      <li>It is easy to get to the edit page and edit a habit. → Ease of use of editing an existing habit</li>
      <li>It is easy to understand how to mark a habit as finished. → Ease of use of the main action</li>
      <li>It is easy to understand how to view the statistics of a specific habit. → Ease of use of additional insight and statistics</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Methods used</h4>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>SEQ → gives information about the ease of use when doing a task</li>
      <li>SUS → gives an overview as a whole about the usability of the app and helps compare different versions of the app after changes were made</li>
      <li>Additional questions → help clarify any additional points or get additional insights about a user's thoughts</li>
    </ul>
