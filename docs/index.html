        A project created by Franz-Aurel Huber and Marcus Fichtinger
        during the creative codelabs at the UAS St. Pölten.
    </p>


    <div class="section-outline">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p class="text-center">
            We have chosen use case C and decided to develop our own idea.
            The app is supposed to be a habit tracker. It should help users of any age keep track of a
            habit and keep those
            habits or maybe break bad habits in the long term. <br>
            Users can add habits they want to get accustomed to into their daily life. They then can
            tick a habit they have
            done for that day as finished. Users can get reminded by the app,
            that they should check on their habits and also get motivated through them. <br>
        <h4>Example use cases:</h4>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Drinking more water</li>
            <li>Getting more active</li>
            <li>Read x amount of pages of a book</li>
            <li>Meditate</li>
        </ul>

            </li>
            <li><strong>Reminder: </strong>A boolean that is set to true if the user ticked the reminder

            </li>
            <li><strong>Finished: </strong>Saves a timestamp of the current day, when a habit is ticked.

            <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
        </summary>
        <p>For the heuristic evaluation, Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics were used.</p>

        <h4>Visibility of system status:</h4>
        <p><strong>Positive:</strong> The app provides feedback through UI elements like toasts and text
            updates.</p>

        <h4>Match between system and the real world:</h4>
        <p><strong>Positive:</strong> The use of icons for "Add", "Edit", and "Stats" is in line with
            other apps, well-known
            and consistent.</p>
        <p><strong>Negative:</strong> Some technical terms or icons, such as the circle when it is not
            checked, might not be
            intuitive for all users.</p>

        <h4>User control and freedom:</h4>
        <p><strong>Positive:</strong>
            Users can navigate back using the "Back" button or the system-wide gesture. <br>
            Users can undo a checkmark by using the same swipe gesture or by tapping the same button
            again.</p>
        <p><strong>Negative:</strong> The delete button might be frustrating because of accidental
            deletion, because there
            is no confirmation dialog, for example. (Changes will be made accordingly)</p>

        <h4>Consistency and standards:</h4>
        <p><strong>Positive:</strong> The app uses consistent design patterns and color schemes.</p>
        <p><strong>Negative:</strong> A swiping gesture might not be the most known standard (intuitive)
            for ticking off a
            checkmark, therefore a tap to check should also be implemented. (Changes will be made
            accordingly)</p>

        <h4>Error prevention:</h4>
        <p><strong>Positive:</strong> The app minimizes errors by providing clear options and feedback,
            such as when trying
            to check a habit on a day other than the set repeating day.</p>
        <p><strong>Negative:</strong> Some error prevention mechanisms might be too restrictive,
            limiting user flexibility.
            (Delete confirmation might slow down a user)</p>

        <h4>Recognition rather than recall:</h4>
        <p><strong>Positive:</strong> The app displays options and information directly, reducing the
            need for memory.</p>
        <p><strong>Negative:</strong> Users need to remember which day they set to repeat on the main
            screen, because it
            only tells the user how many days in the month this day exists. A user also needs to
            remember the swipe gestures
            (Changes for redundancy will be implemented - Expert Users)</p>

        <h4>Flexibility and efficiency of use:</h4>
        <p><strong>Positive:</strong> The app supports efficient navigation with buttons, gestures and
            transitions.</p>
        <p><strong>Negative:</strong> Advanced users might find the app lacking in terms of
            customization options.</p>

        <h4>Aesthetic and minimalist design:</h4>
        <p><strong>Positive:</strong> The design is clean and focused, with minimal clutter.</p>
        <p><strong>Negative:</strong> Minimalist design might lead to oversimplification, hiding
            important features or
            information behind icons etc.</p>

        <h4>Recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:</h4>
        <p><strong>Positive:</strong> The app provides clear feedback for actions, helping users
            understand the system
            state.</p>
        <p><strong>Negative:</strong> Error messages might not be detailed enough to help users diagnose
            and recover from
            issues.</p>

        <h4>Help and documentation:</h4>
        <p><strong>Positive:</strong> The app's design is intuitive, reducing the need for any
            documentation.</p>
        <p><strong>Negative:</strong> Lack of any tutorials or documentation might leave users confused
            and frustrated.
            (Changes have been made - Onboarding added for first-time users)</p>

        <h3>Test Protocol</h3>
        <p class="text-center">
            The main focus of our user test is to find out any problems or unintuitive elements of the app.
            By testing the ease
            of use of many functionalities of the app, we want to determine if there are confusing or
            unintuitive parts that
            need reiterating. Besides the methods mentioned below, observations also play a part in
            determining where a user
            might be struggling.
            Information about the user test was given to the participants at the beginning of the form.
        </p>
        <h4>Hypothesis</h4>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>It is intuitive to create a repeating habit. → Ease of use of adding a new habit</li>
            <li>It is easy to get to the edit page and edit a habit. → Ease of use of editing an existing
                habit
            </li>
            <li>It is easy to understand how to mark a habit as finished. → Ease of use of the main action
            </li>
            <li>It is easy to understand how to view the statistics of a specific habit. → Ease of use of
                additional insight and
                statistics
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Methods used</h4>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>SEQ → gives information about the ease of use when doing a task</li>
            <li>SUS → gives an overview as a whole about the usability of the app and helps compare
                different versions of the
                app after changes were made
            </li>
            <li>Additional questions → help clarify any additional points or get additional insights about a
                user's thoughts

        <h3>User Test Results</h3>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p class="text-center">
            In total 7 participants did the user tests with 2 different versions of the app. Between the 2
            different versions of
            the app, the app was updated accordingly depending on the received feeback of the participants.
            Because of the large amount of feedback only 3 users did the first test before already doing
            changes to the app. <br><br>
            <strong>Demographics:</strong><br>
            First test: 3 male 20-25<br>
            Second test: 1 male, 2 female 19-24 ; 1 female 50-59
        </p>
        <h4>SUS Scores</h4>
        <p class="text-center">
            The average SUS Score of the 1st test was <strong>65.83</strong>. And after making the changes based on the
            feedback received by
            users
            the average SUS Score of the 2nd test was <strong>85.625</strong>. The SUS Score increased by around 20 points,
            which speaks in favor of the made changes.
        </p>
        <h4>SEQ Scores</h4>
        <p class="text-center">
            The process of editing (Task 2) was significantly more intuitive after the changes were made.
            The changes included an onboarding tutorial and the ability to click the circle itself to tick
            off a habit. Task 4 is left out here, because in the first test version there wasn't a 4th task, therefore it can't be compared.

        </div>
        </p>
        <h4>Gesture intuitiveness</h4>
        <p class="text-center">
            As described before the tutorial helped users understand the swiping gesture to tick off and
            edit a habit. Before the changes a total of 3 people said the gestures were unintuitive. 
            After the changes 3 people said the gestures were intuitive with 1 person still finding them unintuitive.

        </p>
        <h4>Most relevant feedback and made changes</h4>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Users found the swiping gesture to tick off a habit unintuitive. -> Made icon itself
                clickable in addition to swiping.
            </li>
            <li>Users found the swiping gesture to edit a habit unintuitive. -> Added a edit icon in the
                statistics screen.
            </li>
            <li>Users found the delete button too easy to accidentally press. -> Added a confirmation dialog
                for deleting.
            </li>
            <li>Users didn't clearly understand what the 0/31 Days meant the first time. -> Included current
                month heading on the main screen.
            </li>
            <li>Users didn't even find the gestures to quickly edit or tick a habit. -> Included tutorial at
                first time startup.
            </li>

        <h3>Final reflection</h3>
        <details class="collapsible text-center card">
        <summary><h4>Franz-Aurel Huber</h4></summary>
        <p>
            I am very proud of how close we got to our initial Figma designs and our vision of how the
            app should work and behave.
            The app looks almost identical to the mockups we created and feels good and stable to use.
            We started the entire project with a shared Kanban board (Trello) to keep track of what still needed
            to be done.
            This turned out to be a great idea because, on the one hand, the workload was split very
            evenly, and on the other, the variety of coding challenges each of us had to implement was
            great because we always just picked the next item on our "Not Started/Ideas" list as soon as we
            finished something.
            <br>
            If we had more time for the project, I would have loved to polish the notification feature
            even further with
            features like marking a habit as done directly from the notification or setting a specific
            time to be notified by
            the app. Another feature I would have liked to see, which we weren’t able to implement, was
            reordering the habits on the MainView.
        </p>
        </details>
        <details class="collapsible text-center card">
            <summary><h4>Marcus Fichtinger</h4></summary>
            <p>
            The most challenging part overall was definitely the constant reiterating of the app design based on user tests. The tasks were spread by having a shared task list
            where we both worked on different parts of the app. The initial design was mostly done by Franz and the database setup by Marcus, with the rest of it being split up evenly.
            <br>
            We have gotten very close to our initial concept and I think we have reached everything we aimed for. The notifications aren't as customisable yet as we would have liked them to be
            and the statistics screen could have more information to motivate a user to keep up with their habits. For example scrolling back through the past months.
            <br>
            But overall we are very happy with the outcome of the project.
